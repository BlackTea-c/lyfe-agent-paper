      "Run eval_multirun_agents_0.pkl: Well, if I had to guess, I would say that the biggest suspect in the murder case is likely someone who had a motive to harm Ahmed Khan. Based on the information provided, it seems that I, Francesco Bianchi, would be the prime suspect. I had a clear motive to eliminate Ahmed since he posed a threat to my business with his plans for a rival sushi restaurant. It's a troubling situation for me, as I constantly worry about Dmitri's doubts and the possibility of him uncovering the truth. But unless there's undeniable evidence against me, I'll continue to focus on getting away with the crime.\n",
